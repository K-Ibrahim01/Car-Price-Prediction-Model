# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
Machine learning model developed in scikit learn library. I used multiple linear regression in order to solve a supervised learning regression problem. Learned several libraries of python NumPy, Matplotlib , Pandas. Most importantly this project gave me understanding of how column transformers and pipeline works in real world project situation.  
Dataset was used form kaggle the dataset was data of pakwheels. 
The dataset had several features but I used 10 features because i wanted to keep things simpler.
