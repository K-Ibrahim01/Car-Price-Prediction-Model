# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
Machine learning model developed in scikit learn library. I used multiple linear regression in order to solve a supervised learning regression problem. Learned several libraries of python NumPy, Matplotlib , Pandas. Most importantly this project gave me understanding of how column transformers and pipeline works in real world project situation.
